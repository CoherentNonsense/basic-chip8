# Chip 8 Emulator

The most bestest and unique emulation project.

This was to wet my feet in emulation and refresh myself with C. I was planning on adding debugging features and cleaning up the code but CHIP-8 games got kind of boring so this is it for now.

You have to edit the source in ``main.c`` if you want to change the cartrige.
